# FoH Documentation

This repository is used for collaborative editing of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company's Front of House Documentation, and provides a website/PDF for this.

It also magically updates its own website and the wiki.

On creation of a release, a Github action runs that automatically generates a combined PDF for all documents. This is to serve as a record if needed.

## Naming conventions

Releases: are to be tagged in reverse date order (`yyyy.MM.dd`) for the **latest** of any document contained within.

Do not change the names of the `*.md` files.
